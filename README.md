# Doubly Linked List Implementation #
This program is designed to meet the following minimum requirements:
* Build a command line executable in Java (8 or later) that allows us to create, manipulate, display the current state
of, and save a list of items (strings)
* Support the following features:
    1) Show items in the list in current order
    2) Allow adding items to front, back, or a given position in the middle of the list, while preserving order
    3) Delete an Item from anywhere in the list, while preserving order
    4) Load and save the list to/from a file on disk in a human-readable file format

### Project Details ###
To run the command line interface, run the main method contained in the `Main` class. The program contains instructions
on how to interact with your DLL on startup.
